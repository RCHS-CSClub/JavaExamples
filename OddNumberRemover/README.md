# JavaExamples
Sample APCSA Problems #1:

# Challenge:

    Create a Java program that accepts an integer number (you can have the number sit in code, or use the scanner class) and changes any odd digits in the number into zeros, and outputs that number

# Suggestions:

    -Create a new class to handle the logic
    -Use a lot of For Loops
    -Arrays might be helpful
    -It might be helpful to know how many digits are in the number (maybe use a method to find out?)
    -In For Loops, you can get creative with the parameters, you don't have to stick to 
    (int i=0; i<x; i++>), you can do something like (int g=1; g<Math.pow(10,places); g*=10)
    -There is no correct solution, but try your best!
