# JavaExamples
Sample APCSA Problems #1:

# Challenge:

    Create a Java program that accepts a string and integer number (you can have the string and number sit in code, or use the scanner class) and removes a number of indexes randomly equal to the integer number provided.

# Suggestions:

    -Create a new class to handle the logic
    -For Loops may be helpful
    -Arrays are unnessary
    -It might be helpful to know how many indexes are in the string (maybe using a built-in method?)
    -myString.Substring(x,y) is your friend!
    -Math.Random() is your friend!
    -It would be good practice to filter your int inputs if using the scanner class, to stop from being given values that are larger than the string has indexes. 
    -There is no correct solution, but try your best!
